### About this project

    This project is just for testing myself. I received this one on Jan/2020. 
    But just now I started. Why? I was looking for something that I could keep coding, 
    As I am in Australia studying and It's hard find a job here, I thought this project is
    interesting for me. Because I can to pratice interesting things like to use relationship n:n, 
    Authenticatition/Authorization, Docker, CI/CD, Unit/Integratuion tests. 
    By the way, I am putting into more things that I learned in real projects. 

     

### Challenger

    You were hired by DETRAN to create a web solution for registering licensed drivers (CNH) 
    and recording all purchases and sales of vehicles made by drivers. The system must register,
    change and delete vehicles and drivers. The system should allow consulting of all the owners 
    of a vehicle given its license plate. As well as allowing you to consult a driver's car history 
    by CPF. Because it has non-public data, the application must have a login and only authorized 
    and previously registered people will be able to use this system. The application must have a 
    frontend for the user and interact with an API that will be responsible for business rules and 
    data persistence in a relational database. All transactions must be authenticated
