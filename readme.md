### CHALLENGER

<p>
You were hired by DETRAN to create a web solution for registering licensed drivers (CNH) 
and recording all purchases and sales of vehicles made by drivers. The system must register,
 change and delete vehicles and drivers. The system should allow consulting of all the owners 
 of a vehicle given its license plate. As well as allowing you to consult a driver's car history 
 by CPF. Because it has non-public data, the application must have a login and only authorized 
 and previously registered people will be able to use this system. The application must have a 
 frontend for the user and interact with an API that will be responsible for business rules and 
 data persistence in a relational database. All transactions must be authenticated
